# Documentation for the Python Script

## Brief Description
This script serves the purpose of defining an addition function, executing a series of tests on it, and providing different methods to convert two lists into a dictionary.

## Functions and Parameters

### 1. `add(a, b)`
- **Purpose**: This function takes two numerical inputs and returns their sum.
- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: The first number (can be an integer or a float) to be added.
  - `b`: The second number (can be an integer or a float) to be added.
- **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b`.

### 2. `test_add()`
- **Purpose**: This function tests the `add` function to verify its correctness.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Returns**: None. It raises AssertionError if any of the test cases fail.

## Example Usage
To run the script and see the tests executed, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual filename of your script. If all tests pass, it will output:

```
All test passed
```

### Dictionary Creation Methods
The script demonstrates three methods for converting two lists into a dictionary:
- **Method 1**: Using `zip()` with `dict()`
    ```python
    dict_method_1 = dict(zip(keys_list, values_list))
    ```

- **Method 2**: Using dictionary comprehension with `zip()`
    ```python
    dict_method_2 = {key:value for key, value in zip(keys_list, values_list)}
    ```

- **Method 3**: Using a loop with `zip()`
    ```python
    items_tuples = zip(keys_list, values_list)
    dict_method_3 = {}
    for key, value in items_tuples:
        if key not in dict_method_3:
            dict_method_3[key] = value
    ```

## Dependencies Required
This script requires Python 3.x to run. There are no additional third-party libraries required to execute the functions in this script, as it relies solely on built-in Python features.
