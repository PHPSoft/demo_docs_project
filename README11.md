# Documentation for S3 Vulnerability Checker Script

## Overview
This Python script checks AWS S3 buckets for potential vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the naming convention that may expose predictable patterns used by AWS CDK, and the public accessibility of the bucket's Access Control List (ACL) and bucket policy.

## Function Descriptions

### `is_vulnerable_s3_bucket(bucket_name, account_id)`
Checks if a given S3 bucket is vulnerable by evaluating its name and permissions.

#### Parameters:
- **`bucket_name`** (str): The name of the S3 bucket to be checked.
- **`account_id`** (str): The AWS account ID to verify the naming pattern of the bucket.

#### Function Logic:
1. Checks if the bucket name follows the predictable AWS CDK naming pattern using a regular expression.
2. Retrieves the bucket's ACL and checks for any public access.
3. Retrieves the bucket policy and checks for any policies allowing public access.
4. Prints warnings if any vulnerabilities are detected.

### `check_all_buckets()`
Retrieves and checks all S3 buckets in the AWS account for vulnerabilities.

#### Function Logic:
1. Creates an S3 and STS client to interact with the AWS services.
2. Gets the current AWS account ID.
3. Lists all the S3 buckets in the account.
4. Iterates through each bucket and calls `is_vulnerable_s3_bucket()` for vulnerability checks.

## Example Usage
To execute the script and check all S3 buckets in your AWS account for vulnerabilities, simply run the script as follows:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_all_buckets()
```

1. Ensure you have AWS credentials configured on your machine (via `~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables).
2. Execute the Python script.

## Dependencies
This script requires the following dependencies:

- [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html): The AWS SDK for Python, used for interacting with AWS services.
- [botocore](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html): A low-level interface to AWS services, used here to manage exceptions and client operations.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

Make sure to have the necessary AWS permissions to list S3 buckets and access their ACLs and policies:

- `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
- `s3:GetBucketAcl`
- `s3:GetBucketPolicy`
- `sts:GetCallerIdentity`
